# Starter plan-time test suite for the FleetMind root module.
#
# Scope: catches configuration-level regressions (bad interpolations,
# resource wiring, count/for_each mistakes) via `terraform plan` against a
# mocked "aws" provider. No AWS credentials are used or required for the test
# runs; CI still needs network access during `terraform init` to download the
# registry providers/modules unless a mirror/cache is configured.
#
# Deliberately NOT covered here (would need `command = apply` against a real
# or fake backend, real credentials, or a much heavier mocking setup):
#   - actual resource attribute values returned by AWS
#   - drift/apply behavior
#   - the nats/task-ledger submodules' internal logic in isolation
# Expand this suite incrementally as regressions are found, rather than
# trying to reach full coverage in one pass.
