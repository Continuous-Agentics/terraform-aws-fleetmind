# Contributing to terraform-aws-fleetmind

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This repo contains the AWS Terraform module used by FleetMind fleets, so changes should be deliberate, reviewable, and explicit about operator impact.

## Dev Setup

**Prerequisites:** Terraform `>= 1.5` and AWS provider compatibility with the checked-in lockfile.

External contributors should fork first, then clone their fork:

```bash
gh repo fork Continuous-Agentics/terraform-aws-fleetmind --clone
cd terraform-aws-fleetmind
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform init -backend=false
terraform validate
```

Maintainers can clone upstream directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Continuous-Agentics/terraform-aws-fleetmind.git
cd terraform-aws-fleetmind
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform init -backend=false
terraform validate
```

Do not run `terraform apply` against a real AWS account unless the PR explicitly needs a live infrastructure smoke test.

## Test Conventions

- Run `terraform fmt -check -recursive` for every change.
- Run `terraform init -backend=false` and `terraform validate` before opening a PR.
- For IAM, bootstrap, SSM, Secrets Manager, S3, DynamoDB, or Cloud Map changes, include either a live smoke-test note or a clear reason validation-only evidence is enough.
- Keep examples, docs, variables, outputs, and changelog aligned.
- Redact AWS account IDs, secret names containing customer identifiers, Terraform state, Slack tokens, GitHub App credentials, and provider API keys before sharing logs.

## Compatibility Contract

This module is consumed by `fleetmind-template` and driven by generated tfvars from `@continuous-agentics/fleetmind`.

When changing inputs, outputs, IAM policy shape, bootstrap behavior, secret names, S3/DDB layout, or deployment semantics:

- update `CHANGELOG.md`
- update README/docs
- coordinate companion PRs in `fleetmind` and `fleetmind-template` when needed
- update the compatibility matrix in `Continuous-Agentics/fleetmind/docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` when the recommended module baseline changes

## Branch & Commit Conventions

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
feat | fix | docs | chore | refactor | test
```

Branch off `main`:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b fix/your-change
```

Keep PRs focused. Squash noisy WIP commits before opening a PR.

## Pull Request Conventions

- Title: Conventional Commit style, for example `fix: grant deploy-staging read to all agents`.
- Body: describe what changed, why it matters to operators, and how it was verified.
- Link issues with `Closes #123` or `Refs #123`.
- CI must be green before merge.
- Include migration notes for changes that affect existing deployed fleets.
- At least one maintainer approval is required to merge to `main`.

## Where to File Things

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Module bugs | GitHub Issues with the `bug` label |
| Infrastructure feature requests | GitHub Issues with the `enhancement` label |
| Documentation gaps | GitHub Issues or PRs with the `documentation` label |
| Security vulnerabilities | GitHub Security Advisories; do not file publicly |
| CLI or template bugs | File in `fleetmind` or `fleetmind-template` and link back if module behavior is affected |

## Releases

Releases are maintainer-only. Module releases are tagged and consumed by `fleetmind-template` via the `?ref=vX.Y.Z` module source pin.

Before tagging or merging release-affecting changes:

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated.
- [ ] Terraform checks pass.
- [ ] README/docs reflect new inputs, outputs, IAM, bootstrap, or migration behavior.
- [ ] Template/module compatibility is updated if this becomes the recommended baseline.

## Conduct

Be direct, respectful, and constructive. Maintainers may close or edit issues that are spammy, abusive, or unrelated to FleetMind.
